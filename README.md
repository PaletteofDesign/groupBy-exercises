# Groupby Example
## CalIt2 Data Set

In this example we gather the dataset from the following URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mGalarnyk/Tutorial_Data/master/Pandas/CalIt2.data. We rename the columns to make sense in processing the data. We also filter and group the data to achieve the ability to preview data based on certain criteria found in the notebook.
